* About
This is the source branch for the web-presence of the entire Symengine project.
** Contributions
To start working on this site, the following workflow is recommended.
*** Setup
For the first terminal, we will instantiate a ~jupyter~ server.
#+begin_src bash
conda env create -f symedocs.yml
conda activate symedocs
jupyter lab
#+end_src

In another terminal, you can and should set up a file-watching task with a server to visualize the completed docs.

#+begin_src bash
sphinx-autobuild docs public
#+end_src

In case you have cloned the repo for the first time, and are modifying an existing tutorial, note that the ~ipynb~ files need to be created.
#+begin_src bash
cd docs/
conda run "jupytext --to ipynb firststeps.md"
#+end_src
