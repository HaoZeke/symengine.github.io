* About
This is the source branch for the web-presence of the entire Symengine project.
** Generation
The documentation can be generated in a reproducible manner using Nix, or locally in a more accessible manner for non-nix users using ~poetry~.
*** Automated
The easiest way to run is simply to use:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./scripts/builder.sh
#+END_SRC

However, this method is meant primarily for Travis.
*** Poetry
For hacking on the documentation without using ~nix~ simply work with the ~poetry~ environment. As long as the ~doxygen~ version does not deviate too much from the ~nix~ version, everything will work fine in production.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
poetry install
poetry shell
cd docs/Doxygen
doxygen Doxyfile-mcss.cfg
cd ../Sphinx
make html
mv build/html ../../public
#+END_SRC
*** Local Preview
For testing local changes, ~darkhttpd~ is recommended.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# After building
darkhttpd public
#+END_SRC
