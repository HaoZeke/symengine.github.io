* TODO Project Local Tasks
** TODO Make rake task to catch out of sync binder configurations
As per the design document, this task is to be named ~prePub~
** TODO Build and prepare notebooks branch
This is probably best handled by a ~rake~ task, and meant to be a precursor to running Colab notebooks
** TODO Setup instructions for Colab
** TODO Consider adding hoverrefs for the Colab button
With [[https://sphinx-hoverxref.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][this]]
** TODO Basic API Exploration
All of these need to have the same content. Can be kanged from tests.
*** TODO C++
- [ ] Expressions
- [ ] Matrices
*** TODO Python
- [ ] Expressions
- [ ] Matrices
*** TODO Julia
- [ ] Expressions
- [ ] Matrices
*** TODO R
- [ ] Expressions
- [ ] Matrices
** TODO Contributors Guide
** TODO Broken Search
Probably a version thing
* TODO Discussion/Collaborative Tasks
** TODO Analytics
- We could use:
  - [[https://clicky.com/user/][Clicky]]
  - [[https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-googleanalytics/][Google Analytics]]
  - Goat Analytics
Anything really, or even nothing.
** TODO Comments/Annotations
Anything [[https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-comments/][sphinx-comments]] supports is an option, or maybe even [[https://www.remarkbox.com/remarkbox-is-now-pay-what-you-can.html][remarkbox]]
** TODO Benchmarks
- [[https://github.com/certik/scipy-2016-symengine-talk/blob/master/talk.pdf][Scipy presentation PDF]]
  + [[https://github.com/certik/scipy-2016-symengine-talk/blob/master/benchmarks/benchmarks.ipynb][ipynb source]]
- https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv
- Examples
  + https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/benchmarking.html
  + https://www.asmeurer.com/sympy_benchmarks/
  + https://speed.pypy.org/
** TODO Case Studies
*** TODO Code Generation
- [ ] Chemical Kinetics [[https://www.sympy.org/scipy-2017-codegen-tutorial/notebooks/32-chemical-kinetics-symbolic-construction.html][example from sympy]]
*** TODO Optimization
- [ ] Hessian calculations and structure optimization
*** TODO Partial Differential Equation
- [ ] Heat equation or some such
** TODO Wiki Duplication Candidates
Since migration is a bad idea, the following might be useful to have mirrored:
- [[https://github.com/symengine/symengine/wiki/Projects-using-SymEngine][list of projects which use symengine]]
** TODO Production Usage
*** TODO Build Systems
Perhaps migrating some of the wiki content?
** TODO Logo
** TODO Pending Approval
*** TODO Design Document
*** TODO Theme
Switched away from the entire ~jupyter-book~ cabal
*** TODO Python Bindings
[[https://github.com/symengine/symengine.py/pull/335][Here]].
*** TODO Julia Bindings
[[https://github.com/symengine/SymEngine.jl/pull/226][Here]].
* TODO Global Tasks
** TODO Update C++ documentation
This involves merging relevant sections of ~api-docs~
** TODO Depreciate api-docs repository
This is not in keeping with the design document
* WAIT Stretch Goals
** Generate inventories for non-Sphinx projects
[[https://sphobjinv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][sphobjinv]] can build inventories for consumption, and is used in [[https://github.com/svenevs/exhale][exhale]]
